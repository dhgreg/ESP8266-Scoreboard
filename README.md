WIFI scoreboard with game timer, countdown timer, 4 judges and editing of score 
This is a work based on esp8266-fastled-websever and the Great work of FASTLED, esp8266 for arduino and many many others. THANK YOU for your hard work!

The score board is:
  Wifi enabled (in AP mode), with a captive portal (so you can go to any.com and it will load the index.htm), WPA-PSK security.
